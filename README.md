# Web Based Systems NBA Player Viewer

> A Simple `React.js` application made using the [**SparqlTransformer**](https://github.com/D2KLab/sparql-transformer) package. Done for course purposes, main objective was to use a library in-code to traverse through an RDF database in order to create a web app.
