# Web Based Systems NBA Player Viewer

> A Simple `React.js` application made using the [**SparqlTransformer**](https://github.com/D2KLab/sparql-transformer) package. Done for course purposes, main objective was to use a library in-code to traverse through an RDF database in order to create a web app.

I will be updating the project as the days go by. I am currently working on the filtering & will soon be adding a details page when clicking on a player's card. I also plan on making it responsive and mobile-friendly. You can find a link to the live app [**here.**](https://kralmarko123.github.io/wbs-nba-viewer/)
